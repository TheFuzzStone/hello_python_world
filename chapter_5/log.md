## Day 8

January 24, 2019


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: ==3 hours==

**Today's Progress**: Today's not a very productive day. I read everything until task 5-1. I've done almost 70% of the task 5-1. I will finish it tomorrow and upload it to GitHub.


**Thoughts**:  Thought it would be harder. Even though it wasn't a productive day, I think I learned the subject pretty well. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the chapter #5.

## Day 9
January 25, 2019


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: ==1 hour 30 minutes==

**Today's Progress**: Repeated subsections from yesterday. Finished the task in which I combined tasks 5-1 and 5-2. Learned simple `if` and `if-else` statements, and also the `if-elif-else` chain. Learned how to use multiple `elif` blocks and situations where and how I can omit the `else` block.

**Thoughts**: I spent a little time on studying today, but I learned a good piece of information. I've just had the thought of adding the line "**Plans for tomorrow**" to my log...

## Day 10
January 26, 2019

 **Time allocated for study (approximately)**: ==1 hour ==
 
 **Today's Progress**: Repeated subsections from yesterday. Learned how to testing multiple conditions, done tasks 5-3 and 5-4.
 
**Thoughts**: I've learned the basics `if`, `if-else` and `if-elif-else` pretty well. Looked at the 5-5 task... I want to sleep... That's enough for today.
