## Day 8

January 24, 2019

---

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: ==3 hours==

**Today's Progress**: Today's not a very productive day. I read everything until task 5-1. I've done almost 70% of the task 5-1. I will finish it tomorrow and upload it to GitHub.


**Thoughts**:  Thought it would be harder. Even though it wasn't a productive day, I think I learned the subject pretty well. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the chapter #5.
