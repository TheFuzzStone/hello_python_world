## Day 8

January 24


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today's not a very productive day. I read everything until task 5-1. I've done almost 70% of the task 5-1. I will finish it tomorrow and upload it to GitHub.


**Thoughts**:  Thought it would be harder. Even though it wasn't a productive day, I think I learned the subject pretty well. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the chapter #5.

## Day 9
January 25


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: Repeated subsections from yesterday. Finished the task in which I combined tasks 5-1 and 5-2. Learned simple `if` and `if-else` statements, and also the `if-elif-else` chain. Learned how to use multiple `elif` blocks and situations where and how I can omit the `else` block.

**Thoughts**: I spent a little time on studying today, but I learned a good piece of information. I've just had the thought of adding the line "**Plans for tomorrow**" to my log...
