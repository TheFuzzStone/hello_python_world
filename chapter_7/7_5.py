### 7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different
# ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person
# is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are
# between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are
# over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which
# you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
# of their movie ticket.

prompt = "\nHow old are you?"
prompt += "\nEnter 'quit' to finish. \n:"
message = 'Ticket price is: '

while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    if age == 'quit':
        break
    age = int(age)

    if age < 3:
        print(message + "0$.")
    elif age < 13:
        print(message + "10$.")
    else:
        print(message + "15$")
