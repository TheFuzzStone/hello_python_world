# 11-3. Employee: Write a class called Employee.
#The __init__() method should take in a first name, a last name, and
# an annual salary, and store each of these as attributes. Write a
# method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual salary by
# default but also accepts a different raise amount. Write a test case
# for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_ default_raise() and
# test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have
# to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run your test
# case, and make sure both tests pass.
