# hello_python_world.py
A couple of days ago, I started learning Python, and this is just a log of my progress. 

I started studying Python from a book called "Python Crash Course" by [Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/). In my opinion, it's a great book for total newbies in programming like me. Why I think that? Because I spent a couple of days looking for worthwhile books, according to people who have some experience in programming on Python. I tried to watch YouTube from different bloggers... Still, not the same effect. So I was very happy when I found this book. 

If you're looking for a book to start studying Python, try to start with that book.
