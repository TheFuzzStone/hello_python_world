## Day 8

January 24


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today's not a very productive day. I read everything until task 5-1. I've done almost 70% of the task 5-1. I will finish it tomorrow and upload it to GitHub.


**Thoughts**:  Thought it would be harder. Even though it wasn't a productive day, I think I learned the subject pretty well. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the chapter #5.

## Day 9
January 25


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: Repeated subsections from yesterday. Finished the task in which I combined tasks 5-1 and 5-2. Learned simple `if` and `if-else` statements, and also the `if-elif-else` chain. Learned how to use multiple `elif` blocks and situations where and how I can omit the `else` block.

**Thoughts**: I spent a little time on studying today, but I learned a good piece of information. I've just had the thought of adding the line "**Plans for tomorrow**" to my log...

## Day 11
January 27

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: For some reason, I was stuck on 5-6 task for more that 1 hour, But I finished it.

**Today's Progress**: My Python's study today is pretty weak: 

- Using `if` Statements with Lists:

    - Checking for Special Items
    
    - Checking That a List Is Not Empty
    
**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time studying Grin and wallet713. Damned cryptocurrencies! /s

**Today's Progress**: Using Multiple Lists with `if-else`chain. Done 5-8; 5-9 and 5-10 tasks. 

**Thoughts**: A little stuck on task 5-10. I understood the task very well. I had to do a little work and remember how to create lists and how to apply the `lower()` function. I had a great feeling when I found a solution and solved this task.

---

## Day 15
January 31

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 4 hours

**Today's Progress**: Done task 5-11. The task 5-12 (*Styling `if` statements: Review the programs you wrote in this chapter, and
make sure you styled your conditional tests appropriately*) did it by "accident". Earlier I had read the recommendations on code writing (PEP 8) and although I am still a rookie in Python's world, I'm looking to write readable and clean code, because I plan to take part in different open source projects in the future. And that's it, I've finished the chapter 5. ðŸ™‚

Started studying chapter 6: **Dictionaries**. I have read the following subchapters: "*A Simple Dictionary*"; "*Working with Dictionaries*"; "*Accessing Values in a Dictionary*"; "*Adding New Key-Value Pairs*"; "*Starting with an Empty Dictionary*"; "*Modifying Values in a Dictionary*"; "*Removing Key-Value Pairs*"; 

**Thoughts**: Today I had a nice and productive day. ðŸ™‚

## Day 16

February 1

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Sub-chapters done: "*A Dictionary of Similar Objects*", "*Looping Through All Key-Value Pairs*", "*Looping Through All the Keys in a Dictionary*", "*Looping Through a Dictionaryâ€™s Keys in Order*".

Done tasks 6-1 and 6-2. 

**Thoughts**: Today is friday. It's time to rest.

## Day 17
February 2

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 4 hours

**Today's Progress**: Quickly repeated yesterday's subsections, done tasks 6-4; 6-5 and 6-6. 

 I also learned these subsections:

* Looping Through All Values in a Dictionary
* A List of Dictionaries
* A List in a Dictionary
* A Dictionary in a Dictionary

**Thoughts**: With each section it becomes more and more difficult, but on the other hand more interesting. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the subsections I have learned in the last two days.

February 5

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: Started studying Chapter 7 "*User Input and while Loops*", done the following tasks: 7-1, 7-2 and 7-3.

**Thoughts**: And again, I started studying in the afternoon which means:


```
m = input('What time are you going to start studying? (enter an integer number): '  )
m = int(m)
if m >= 10:
    print('Don\'t even hope to have a productive day. :-()')
elif m < 6:
    print('It\'s too early! :-/')
else:
    print('You\'ll have a productive day! :-)')
```

## Day 22
February 9

I missed two days. I didn't have a chance to learn Python at all for two days.

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Repeated the chapters I learned at day 21 (February 6) and finished the Chapter 7. Done tasks: 7-4, 7-5, 7-7, 7-8, 7-9, and 7-10.

**Thoughts**: In chapter 7 I learned how to use `input()`, flags, `break` and `continue` statements, how to interact with the information that the user will provide (text and numerical input), how to use `while` loops to make programs run as long as "users" want them to. How to use `while` loop to move items from one list to another, and how to remove all instances of a value from a list. Also how `while` loops can be used with dictionaries.

* Positional Arguments (multiple function calls, order matters in positional arguments); 

* Keyword Arguments

* Default Values

* Equivalent Function Calls

**Thoughts**: I stuck on the subchapter "**Return Values**". Read it a few times, I don't fully understand it. I guess that's enough for today. Tomorrow I will quickly repeat some of the strokes and continue from "**Return Values**". 

---

## Day 25

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: I started today with a quick repeat of yesterday's topics I stopped on `return` a little bit more (I watched one video on YouTube to make sure that I understood everything correctly). Learned the following subchapters:

* Modifying a List in a Function

* Preventing a Function from Modifying a List

Done tasks 8-9, 8-10 and 8-11.

**Thoughts**: I haven't learned Python for 12 days. There was no time for that. And today it was really hard to start again. I've spent over an hour today repeating previous stuff. and then I couldn't get on with it, I couldn't concentrate. Systematicity is the key to success, imho.

## Day 27

I've done the following tasks: from 8-12 to 8-16

**Thoughts**: I had a great, productive day! I finished a very important and interesting chapter â„–8 "**Functions**". The chapter ended with some recommendations from **PEP 8**... Tomorrow I will definitely read the entire section **PEP 8** in order to follow the generally accepted rules in the Python community and write a beautiful code. 

---

## Day 28

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 3 hours 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: As usual, I started by repeating the previous stuff. And before I proceeded to section 9, I went to read **[PEP 8](https://pythonworld.ru/osnovy/pep-8-rukovodstvo-po-napisaniyu-koda-na-python.html)**. Then, I started section 9 "**Classes**". I watched a couple of videos on YouTube about `class` and then learned the following chapters from the book:

* Creating and Using a Class

	* Creating the Dog Class

	* The `__init__()` Method
	
* Making an Instance from a Class

	* Calling Methods

	* Creating Multiple Instances

**Today's Progress**: Repeated yesterday's stuff + learned a few subchapters:

* Working with Classes and Instances

	* The Car Class
	* Setting a Default Value for an Attribute
	* Modifying Attribute Values
	* Modifying an Attributeâ€™s Value Directly
	* Modifying an Attributeâ€™s Value Through a Method
	* Incrementing an Attributeâ€™s Value Through a Method

**Thoughts**: I've been in town most of the day doing some stuff offline. Therefore, I repeated yesterday's material in public transport from my smartphone. It's a good thing that I was repeating yesterday's subchapters. I understood them really well. 

When I got home, I learned a few more subchapters.

	* The `__init__()` Method for a Child Class
	* Defining Attributes and Methods for the Child Class

**Thoughts**: The more I learn about classes, the more I understand where it can be used. 

Today is the 30th day of my study of Python. I'm happy with my results ðŸ˜Š. 
To be honest, I don't even know how to evaluate my results. Anyway, I'm not gonna stop with the progress I've made.
