## Day 8

January 24


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 3 hours

**Today's Progress**: Today's not a very productive day. I read everything until task 5-1. I've done almost 70% of the task 5-1. I will finish it tomorrow and upload it to GitHub.


**Thoughts**:  Thought it would be harder. Even though it wasn't a productive day, I think I learned the subject pretty well. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the chapter #5.

## Day 9
January 25


**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: Repeated subsections from yesterday. Finished the task in which I combined tasks 5-1 and 5-2. Learned simple `if` and `if-else` statements, and also the `if-elif-else` chain. Learned how to use multiple `elif` blocks and situations where and how I can omit the `else` block.

**Thoughts**: I spent a little time on studying today, but I learned a good piece of information. I've just had the thought of adding the line "**Plans for tomorrow**" to my log...

 **Today's Progress**: Repeated subsections from yesterday. Learned how to testing multiple conditions, done tasks 5-3 and 5-4.

## Day 11
January 27

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: For some reason, I was stuck on 5-6 task for more that 1 hour, But I finished it.

## Day 13
January 29

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour

**Today's Progress**: My Python's study today is pretty weak: 

- Using `if` Statements with Lists:

    - Checking for Special Items
    
    - Checking That a List Is Not Empty
    
**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time studying Grin and wallet713. Damned cryptocurrencies! /s

## Day 14
January 30

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**: Using Multiple Lists with `if-else`chain. Done 5-8; 5-9 and 5-10 tasks. 

**Thoughts**: A little stuck on task 5-10. I understood the task very well. I had to do a little work and remember how to create lists and how to apply the `lower()` function. I had a great feeling when I found a solution and solved this task.

## Day 15
January 31

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 4 hours

**Today's Progress**: Done task 5-11. The task 5-12 (*Styling `if` statements: Review the programs you wrote in this chapter, and
make sure you styled your conditional tests appropriately*) did it by "accident". Earlier I had read the recommendations on code writing (PEP 8) and although I am still a rookie in Python's world, I'm looking to write readable and clean code, because I plan to take part in different open source projects in the future. And that's it, I've finished the chapter 5. ðŸ™‚

Started studying chapter 6: **Dictionaries**. I have read the following subchapters: "*A Simple Dictionary*"; "*Working with Dictionaries*"; "*Accessing Values in a Dictionary*"; "*Adding New Key-Value Pairs*"; "*Starting with an Empty Dictionary*"; "*Modifying Values in a Dictionary*"; "*Removing Key-Value Pairs*"; 

**Thoughts**: Today I had a nice and productive day. ðŸ™‚

## Day 16

February 1

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 2 hours

**Today's Progress**: Sub-chapters done: "*A Dictionary of Similar Objects*", "*Looping Through All Key-Value Pairs*", "*Looping Through All the Keys in a Dictionary*", "*Looping Through a Dictionaryâ€™s Keys in Order*".

Done tasks 6-1 and 6-2. 

**Thoughts**: Today is friday. It's time to rest.

## Day 17
February 2

**Time allocated for study (approximately)**: 4 hours

**Today's Progress**: Quickly repeated yesterday's subsections, done tasks 6-4; 6-5 and 6-6. 

 I also learned these subsections:

* Looping Through All Values in a Dictionary
* A List of Dictionaries
* A List in a Dictionary
* A Dictionary in a Dictionary

**Thoughts**: With each section it becomes more and more difficult, but on the other hand more interesting. Tomorrow I will definitely repeat the subsections I have learned in the last two days.
