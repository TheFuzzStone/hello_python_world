About a week ago I downloaded Russian translation of the book "**Python Crash Course**" by [Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/). I've never had any programming experience before. I've spent a different amount of time behind a book on different days (sometimes two-three hours, sometimes eight-nine hours). I have briefly reviewed the chapter describing the installation of Python 3.

So, what did I learn in a week :

-  **Variables and Simple Data Types**
 
Of course I said hello to the world :-), acquainted with variables (how to naming and using them, and which names to avoid).

---

-  **Strings and methods** 
Done some simplest tasks with strings like change the case of the words (title, upper, etc.), learned what concatenation is it and how to combine strings. 

---

- **Numbers**

Integers, floats and how to avoid type errors with the str() function.

---

- **The Zen of Python**

... to understand the philosophy of Python.

---


- **Lists**


What is it. How to get access to diffrent elements of the list. Index positions and how to access the list elements knowing their index (and not knowing it). How to modify/add/delete/pop different elements of the list and how to organize them (sort/sorted/reverse)

---

- **Working with lists**

Looping through the list using `for()`, how to avoiding indentation errors (and how to not forget or fix indent error)

---

- **Making numerical lists**

How to use the `range()` function to make a list of numbers and how to get a simple statistics using `min`, `max` and `sum`.

---

- **Working with Part of a List**

How to make a slice and how to work with it, copying a list by creating a slice.

---

- **Tuples**

Defining a tuple and how to to interact with him.

---

- **Styling Your Code**

On my opinion, this is an important section where I learned the main principles of [PEP 8](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

---

This is just a great book! The author gives the material clearly, simply and understandably. The book is distributed free of charge, but I will buy it if I find it in Ukrainian or Russian translation.
