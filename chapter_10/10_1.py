# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and
# write a few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python
# so far. Start each line with the phrase In Python you can...
# Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as
# your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads
# the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents
# once by reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file
# object, and once by storing the lines in a list and then working
# with them outside the with block.
