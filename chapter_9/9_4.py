# 9-4. Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1
# (page 166). Add an attribute called number_served with a
# default value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant
# from this class. Print the number of customers the
# restaurant has served, and then change this value and print
# it again. Add a method called set_number_served() that lets
# you set the number of customers that have been served. Call
# this method with a new number and print the value again.
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you
# increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call
# this method with any num- ber you like that could represent
# how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.
